                    Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
                    It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple 
                    but effective approach to object-oriented programming. 
                    Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic
                    typing, together with its interpreted nature,

                    Objects and Classes
                </header>
                <p>
                    Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. 
                    Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. 
                    Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. 
                    Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
                    Compared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of
                    new syntax and semantics.
                </p>
                <p><b>Object : </b>An object is a collection of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that act on the data. 
                    Every object in Python has a type.
                    In Python we create instances in the following manner.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Instance = class(arguments)</strong>
                    <br>
                    <b>Class : </b> class is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. 
                    Objects are instances of classes, and a class defines a set of attributes and methods that its objects will have. 
                    This allows for the modeling of real-world entities and their behaviors in a structured and reusable way.
                    A class is defined using the class keyword followed by the class name and a colon. 
                    The class body contains attributes and methods that define the behaviors and properties of the class.

                    Inheritance
                </header>
                <p>
                    Inheritance in Python is a key feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a derived or child class) to inherit attributes 
                    and methods from another class (called the base or parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes..
                    <br>
                    <P><b>Inheritance Syntax</b>

                        To create a derived class, you specify the base class in parentheses after the derived class name.
                        <br><i>
                        class DerivedClass(BaseClass):</i></P>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

                    <b>Single Inheritance : </b>In single inheritance, a class (derived class) inherits from one and only one base class. 
                    This is the simplest form of inheritance.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multilevel Inheritance : </b>In multiple inheritance, a class inherits from more than one base class. 
                    The derived class inherits attributes and methods from all specified base classes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multilevel Inheritance : </b>In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a derived class, creating a chain of inheritance. 
                    This forms a hierarchy of classes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hierarchical Inheritance :</b> In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class. 
                    Each derived class has its own implementation but shares the base class’s attributes and methods.


                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hybrid Inheritance :</b> Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. 
                    It can involve multiple, multilevel, or hierarchical inheritance.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Method Of Resolution Order (MRO) :</b>
                    When dealing with multiple inheritance, Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the order in which base classes are accessed. 
                    This order is known as Method Resolution Order (MRO). You can view the MRO of a class using the __mro__ attribute or the mro() method.
                    For example: Combining Hierarchical
                    inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

                    Polymorphism
                </header>
                <p>
                    Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. 
                    The key idea is that a single interface or method can be used to represent different underlying forms (data types). 
                    This capability is essential for creating flexible and easily extensible code.
                    <br>
                    <b>In Python polymorphism is mainly
                        divided into 4 types:</b>
                    <br> 1. Method Overriding<br>
                    2. Method overloading <br>
                    3.Duck typing <br>
                    4.Polymorphism with Abstract Base Classes <br>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Method Overriding:</strong> Method overriding occurs when a derived class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its base class. 
                    This allows derived classes to offer specialized behaviors while sharing the same method name.
                    <br> <strong>Method overloading</strong>: Python does not support method overloading (where multiple methods with the same name but different parameters are defined) in the same way as some other languages like Java or C++. 
                    Instead, Python uses default arguments and variable-length arguments to achieve similar results.
                    <br> <strong>Duck typing </strong> : Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior (methods and properties) rather than its explicit type. 
                    If an object implements a method or behaves in a certain way, it is treated according to that behavior, regardless of its actual class.
                    <br> <strong> Polymorphism with Abstract Base Classes </strong> : Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python provide a way to define common interfaces for a group of related classes. 
                    You can define abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclass.

                    Abstraction
                </header>

                <p>
                    Abstraction in Python is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. 
                    It helps in reducing complexity by providing a simplified interface for interacting with objects while hiding the internal workings.
                    Abstraction allows you to work with higher-level concepts and focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.
                </p>
                <b>Key Aspects Of  Abstraction </b>
                <p>
                    <b>Abstract Classes:</b>Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated directly and are meant to be subclasses. 
                    They can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by any derived (concrete) class. 
                    Abstract methods are defined using the @abstractmethod decorator from the abc module.
                    <br>
                    <b>Encapsulation and Abstraction : </b> <br>
                    Encapsulation (bundling data and methods) is closely related to abstraction. 
                    While encapsulation hides the internal state of an object and provides methods to interact with it, 
                    abstraction focuses on exposing only necessary functionalities and hiding the details of how they are implemented.
                    <br>
                    <b>Using Abstraction in Design : </b> 
                    Abstraction helps in designing systems with a clear separation between high-level logic and low-level implementation. 
                    It allows developers to create complex systems with a focus on interfaces rather than details.

                    Encapsulation
                </header>
                <p>
                    Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. 
                    It also refers to restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which helps in controlling how the data is accessed and modified.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Key Concepts of Encapsulation in Python: </b><br><br>

                    <b>Public Attributes and Methods : </b>By default, attributes and methods in Python are public, meaning they can be accessed and modified from outside the class. 
                    This is the least restrictive form of encapsulation.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Protected Attributes and Methods : </b>Protected attributes and methods are intended to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses. 
                    In Python, this is indicated by a single underscore prefix ('_'), but this is a convention rather than a strict enforcement.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Private Attributes and Methods : </b>Private attributes and methods are intended to be accessible only within the class. 
                    They are indicated by a double underscore prefix ('__'). This name mangling makes them less accessible from outside the class, but not completely private.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Getter and Setter Methods :</b> Getter and setter methods provide controlled access to private attributes. 
                    They allow you to define methods to get and set the values of private attributes, which can include validation or transformation logic.
